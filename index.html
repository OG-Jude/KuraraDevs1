            Phomolo | Unfinished | 14 - June - 2024
        </div>
        <p>This is a chemistry calculator used to solve redox reaction problems. The are 2 variants of this software, the first is to choose 2 of your Redox reaction after that you are required to see the outcome of your REDOX reaction after clicking "Compute". Your results will be seen on the screen. The second variant is TBD as it is still under scripting.</p>

        <h3>Gibbs Free Energy Calculator v1.0.00</h3>
        <div class="tiny">
            Phomolo | Unfinished | 20 - January - 2025
        </div>
        <p >This is a chemistry calculator used to solve Gibbs Free energy linear equation (G = H -TS ) where G is gibbs free energy in K*J/mol; H is heat enthalpy in J ; T is the temperature in K ;  S is the entropy in J/K. This calculator also outputs the favoured reaction direction and the spontaneity of the reaction provided that user has inserted given parameters.
